```{r}
## Week 1)
## Predictive Modeling & Processes
# - The stages of a Data Science Project
# - Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
```

```{r}
## Week 2)
## Data Exploration
# - Summary statistics in R
# - ggplot is great for visualization in R
```


```{r}
## Week 3)
## Linear Regression
# - Linear regression should be the first method used
# - Coefficients are a good way of getting an idea of importance (so long as variables are normalized or scaled)
```


```{r}
## Week 4)
## Classification
# - Logistic Regression is superior to linear regression in Categorical problems
# - A good way to assess a model is determine if it is life or death, or miscategorizing a picture
```


```{r}
## Week 5)
## Generalized Linear Models
# - Poisson regression is used for total number of future events
# - Gamma regression is used to determine time until a specific event
```



```{r}
## Week 6)
## Tree Based Models
# - cv.tree(tree_model) is a great way to assess cross validation of different nodes
# - Trees are a great way to visualize data in layman's terms
```


```{r}
## Week 7)
## Unsupervised Models
# - k-means clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised learning methods
# - library(fpm) utilizes plotcluster which is a great way to visualize it
```


```{r}
## Week 8)
## Delivering Results
# - Commenting code is imperative to making programs understandable to audiences
# - Github is a more comprehensive way to preserve progress without having to save files datetime_posted
